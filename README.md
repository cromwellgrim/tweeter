# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a completely unique website idea and not at all similar to different site about a bird.

You'll have to use my account for now as it is the only user available. 

Please enjoy writing a number of tweets, then hiding the tweeter when you're out of thoughts.

Scroll through all of the tweets until your scroll finger is tired and simply use the arrow to jump back to the top!
